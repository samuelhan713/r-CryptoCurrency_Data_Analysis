Got the general idea from the FIRE community (financial independence, retire early) but instead of buying the S&amp;P every month, I chose to buy bitcoin every month. So, basically I save as much as possible from every salary --&gt; buy as much bitcoin every month as possible. When I have a stack of 1 million euros in fiat terms, I consider myself as successfully retired and most likely gonna quit my job. I document my journey in this blog that I try to update once per month, hopefully you like it interesting and motivating! And whatever your capacity and timing for stacking sats is, I'm pretty sure this kind of 'bitcoin retirement plan' is way more efficient than the government one, so starting anything similar is highly recommended.

22,0.0,0.928,0.072,0.9755,CryptoCurrency,Bitcoin Mempool Ordinal / BRC-20 / DataCarrier transaction comparison?,"Last year I recall seeing a pie-chart that showed how much of the BTC mempool consisted of what type of TXNs. Chart included Legacy, Segwit, Taproot, P2SH, as well as some wedge dedicated to Ordinals or BSC-20. I recall Ordinals / BSC-20 was ""most"" of the mempool.

I've tried and for the life of me I can't find it anywhere. Does anyone recall where that chart might be?

As to WHY I'm interested has to do with the impact of full mempools on TXN costs.  Or more specifically, the cost of moving UTXOs.  Unlike Ethereum, Bitcoin creates a new UTXO for every TXN.  When accumulating Bitcoin, this can lead to dozen's, hundreds, or even thousands of UTXOs.  The TXN cost scales purely based on the UTXO count, not the amount, so a large UTXO set can be expensive to cash in since moving them could be a large percentage of their current value.

Although I know my current number of UTXOs, for planning purposes I need to anticipate what the mining fee rate might be when I try to cash these in in 5, 10, or 15 years.  If the costs stay where they are today, about 60 sat/vB, then that's fine.  But if they grow over 1000 sat/vB then some of my UTXOs could be getting close to dust.  I, personally, feel that Ordinals, BSC-20 tokens, and other datacarrier transactions could help to raise these TXN costs indefinitely.  So to that point, I'd like to monitor whether Ordinals, BSC-20, and datacarrier TXNs are increasing month for month or decreasing over time.  It will help to inform my future investment in Bitcoin.

As a concrete example, there was a post recently where someone bought 0.25 BTC over the course of 4 years.  The bought every day with the intention of getting to 0.25 BTC.  So if all of these individual buys were withdrawn to a hardware wallet, the UTXO count would be 1460 UTXOs.  Even with a balance of 0.25 BTC, the TXN cost to move such a large UTXO set would be almost 0.15 BTC.  That's 60% of the investment consumed by TXN fees.  And that is just at the 2024 fee levels.

So... anyone know a site that an break out the current Bitcoin MEMPOOL into transaction types such as ""datacarrier"" and ""non-datacarrier""?  Or even better, if they can show segwit, taproot, ordinal, bsc-20 and the like.",0.6,1,0,1,1706382807.0,2024-01-27 19:13:27,"['Bitcoin', 'btc', 'Ethereum']",-0.16130946363504822

24,0.026,0.863,0.111,0.9931,CryptoCurrency,"I Took Out $94,000 in Personal Loans to Buy Crypto: 19 Month Update","Not financial advice. 

Greetings All,  

This is my 19 month update since I first took out an unsecured personal loan to buy Bitcoin. You can find my previous updates in my post history. The first is from June 2022. 

A lot has happened since my last update, so I‚Äôll get right to it‚Ä¶

&amp;#x200B;

First off, I managed to completely pay off my 2nd loan of $20,000! 

Work has been better than usual and I had a big job in December that netted me a $12,000 windfall of which the entirety was put towards my loan balance.

Next I decided to buy even more Bitcoin by taking advantage of some really awesome Credit Card Balance Transfer offers that appeared in August/September‚Ä¶

Two of my credit cards were offering 0% APR for the first 18 and 21 months with a one time 3% and 5% transfer fee respectively. I also opened a new card that was offering a similar deal and was approved for a $12,000 limit. That combined with my previous two credit card brought my total to $40,000 in balance transfer potential. 

Balance transfer offers are great because they allow you to simply write a check to yourself and cash it in your bank account like any other check. Also, I‚Äôm only responsible to pay 1% each month, so servicing it is really easy. 

I ended up using $35,000 in balance transfer loans and buying 1.35 Bitcoin at an average price of \~$26,500. This brings my total amount of Bitcoin purchased with loans to 4 Bitcoin!!!!

**With the balance transfer monthly payments, plus the previous loans, my total monthly cost to service all these loans is \~$800.** 

I can easily afford this. In fact, I‚Äôm putting almost double that towards these loans each month to pay them down aggressively so I don‚Äôt end up paying a lot of interest when it‚Äôs all said and done. I plan to have everything paid off in less than two years. 

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

**As of today, of the combined loans / balance transfers I have a total remaining balance of \~$56,000.**

It works out like this:

$21,000 remaining balance from unsecured personal loan.

$35,000 from new balance transfer loans. 

This brings the total amount of loans that I‚Äôve taken out so far to $94,000. I‚Äôve paid a total of \~$4,500 in interest to date, which brings the total cost basis of these loans to \~$98,500 as of January 24th, 2024.

**I have acquired a total of 4 Bitcoin at an average price of \~$24,625 per coin: $98,500 / 4 = $24,625.** 

**As of today, January 25th, 2024, the current price of Bitcoin is \~$40,000.**

**This brings the total value of the Bitcoin I acquired from loans to $160,000.**

**This represents an unrealized USD profit of \~$61,500.** 

The math is simple: $160,000 - $98,500 = $61,500

Lastly, I‚Äôm officially done taking out loans and balance transfers. I have a nice round number of Bitcoin from loans, plus my personal stack which I‚Äôve been slowly adding to from earned income. Now it‚Äôs time to focus on paying everything down over the next 2 years with earned income. I have no desire to sell my Bitcoin regardless of how high its price goes. 

Let me know if you have any questions.

When they are positioned as so with the 50(green) between the 200(red) above and 100(blue) below, we are position for a pump and rally above the major resistance line as we've seen last cycle. The patterns are playing out very similar to last cycle. Litecoins in a huge 2 cycle bull flag and with the Bitcoin ETF approval, this third cycle may be the breakout cycle for Litecoin. How many LTC's do you think is need to be comfortable this cycle? I mean like to quit your job?

Litecoin may not have performed as well as some of the other coins out there but it's a safe bet second to that of bitcoin but with a wild card possibility for it to moon based on a number of factors, which makes it more attractive than bitcoin imo.

Please be aware there are two possible paths from now to breakout. See chart lines in orange and grey.  Grey shows a small pump from here and then a dump first before we're off to the races.

**Part 1:**

So without further adieu here's and the data from last week, 1.19.24:

https://preview.redd.it/x29rgahp7tec1.png?width=684&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ddb277abfaae38d627dcdf783e27cdc7561424a

And here's the data from this week, 1.26.24:

https://preview.redd.it/o2xa3yzp7tec1.png?width=685&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7566f5dfabd2318076a66f29035dfc61a054993

Observations and thoughts:

1. The first thing that jumped out at me is that this is the first time in a number of weeks that we saw some price appreciation in BRICK. I'll be honest I do not follow that sub very closely, maybe someone can help fill in something that may have caused this? But that was surprising.
2. Second thing is that GONE is just chugging along. I think it may be headed for a breakout as the other Polygon RCCs start dropping back. CONE is hanging in there and finally crossed the 26,000 holder number! Big congrats there. 
3. Another interesting thing is that MOON has steadily been dropping in it's supply but the price has also been consistently dropping. However, the number of holders has continued to rise. I wouldn't have guessed that those events would correlate but I think it may be possible we see a bit of an uptick on MOON if holder numbers continue to move upwards.
4. You'll see last week that TACO made a nice jump and overtook PLUNGER on the weekly Market Cap list but PLUNGER flipped 'em back (barely) this week. I thought that was interesting TACO has been creeping up on them for a few weeks now. 
5. Finally I did a little bit of extra research peeking into some of the communities that are on the lower end up the Market Cap here just try and gauge engagement and potential opportunities. It seems engagement in those communities has dropped off a good bit which could be cause for concern. Also, I tried playing around with swaps on MetaMask and found that attempting to swap tokens of those subs was rather difficult which to me means that liquidity looks to be starting to dry up. It may seem like a buy the dip moment but low liquidity can cause you headaches when those bags get heavy.

Anybody sees anything I may have missed or if anything jumps out to you I'd love to here from you!

**Part 2:**

Month-by-Month Analysis - Market Caps

https://preview.redd.it/cu1vtefq7tec1.png?width=431&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=117f57c4cf96f7fcbc8ffef3961c1dd72119d1a9

These charts will show where the market cap for the coin/token was when I started tracking and where it stands at the two month updates I've had so far. 

On maybe a more positive note than point 5, it looks like most of the RCC tokens are up overall from when I started tracking. While MOON, BRICK and DONUT are all down pretty bigly from when I started tracking.

Month-by-Month Analysis - Holders

https://preview.redd.it/i11nx2vq7tec1.png?width=431&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=076d6733f74b947b1253e475e52ff77905e519ab

Holder numbers continue to climb upward, with PLUNGER showing out big time here with their big pop the first month. I also find it pretty interesting that DONUT is the only one in the red here. I think once they get switched over to Arbitrum that will hopefully quell their numbers dropping but time will tell. Prior to looking at this information about holders I put a lot of stock into seeing progress here but now I think I may need to not consider it quite as much when determining my thoughts on each token.

That's all for now! Thanks for hanging with me through it. Hope you have a great rest of your day!",0.73,5,0,5,1706286119.0,2024-01-26 16:21:59,"['link', 'Polygon', 'Arbitrum']",-0.8537470007253986

This is still early days, though. The testnet launch on Goerli had a hiccup, but they fixed it within hours, which is pretty impressive. The next testnet deployments are coming up soon, and if all goes well, mainnet liftoff is targeted for early to mid-March!

I've seen a number of phishing scams use the 'increaseAllowance' function of late to drain wallets. Most of these can be attributed to known Scams as a Service wallet drainers like Inferno, Pink, Angel, and others.

The CREATE2 Function creates new wallet addresses for each malicious signature. According to Scamsniffer, after the victim signs the signature, the Drainer creates a contract at that address and transfers the user‚Äôs assets.

They can keep doing this for quite a long period of time, this can keep going even after the BTC halving.

There is not enough purchase power to absorb 1 billion worth of BTC sold weekly (at 40k$).
That's literally 21 Billion worth of BTC(525k x 40k).  That's 5 months selling a billion worth of BTC each week at 40k.

I'm also curious why aren't they selling OTC? Aren't there some laws for that? Selling spot on Coinbase every time absolutely kills the market.
Who has interest to keep BTC low? Are they helping Blackrock and the others to acquire cheap BTC as much as possible? What's the idea here?

I was specifically referring to the parabolic all-time high that acts as an indicator for the end of the bull market and the beginning of the bear.

If you're buying whatever is getting pushed on youtube by a youtuber, there's a chance you'll make some money, there's a chance you'll lose some money. The exchanges don't care about that. They care about the fees that you pay when you trade...                 

You know, that fee you paid when you traded USDT or FIAT for that one coin you wanted? And then that other fee you paid when it went down in value and you hopped onto the next hyped coin? And then that other fee you paid to withdraw that coin from the exchange and put it on your hardware wallet or hot wallet? Yeah, you and tens of thousands of other people paid the same fee, netting the exchange(s) a few thousand dollars.               

This is precisely why you see exchanges promoting -insert coin here- trading contest. They take the trading fees. And if there are derivatives on it, that's even more beneficial to the exchange because then you are literally gambling against the house. It is also the same exact reason why you see the exchanges willing to take meme coins and promote trading of said meme coins on their exchanges.

I'm also in the anti-regulation team so make no mistake about that. 

One crypto company in particular, LCX (short for the Liechtenstein Crypto assets Exchange) was very present over there, hosted a diner with a lot of eminent people in the crypto space as well as a bunch of eminent Liechtenstein politicians. This year their booth was right next to Coinbases booth.

LCX attends Davos every year and it's always the same story: little pump during the event, hard correction afterwards, except for this year. We're witnessing the crypto market is in a downtrend the past two weeks and usually LCX would drop twice as much as the rest. Not this year. It keeps pumping against the market. 

I've got to give it to them that the presentations were much better, the exposure was a lot more and the people attending the speeches and the diner were the kind of people with big bags of money or were quite important compared to other years. 

So what is that they spoke about at Davos and who is investing into this? I have a feeling they are cooking something at the WEF with the support of big banking and politicians, so I can't help myself but to think LCX is going to have a big roll in the near future in the crypto space. Does anybody have more info about what is said behind the WEF curtains? Do we have somebody in this sub who attended Davos and maybe picked up something over there? 

Again: I'm not favouring any of this, but I'm not allergic to making a hell of a lot of money. And I have a gut feeling this could be the golden ticket. 

So if anybody knows anything I'd highly appreciate it if you step forward. I do own a bag of LCX but considering the above I'm eager to expand the bag with a substantial amount.

80,0.033,0.888,0.079,0.9667,CryptoCurrency,UK ISA / SIPP - my findings on how to get proper Bitcoin exposure,"After a lot of digging around, here are my findings:

ISA: Under the current HMRC guidance on qualifying investments, there is NO route as of now to getting direct etp / etf bitcoin exposure in an ISA. That's mainly because no such products in the market are UK ucits or recognised UCITS. However, if you retain isa positions in BTCE (which you could have in the July to Dec 2020 window) then these remain eligible but only as long as you hold them. Once you sell, you cannot re-enter this within an ISA.

SIPP: Here is where things are interesting. The first thing you need to access Bitcoin etps / etfs is to be able to qualify for a Mifid Professional Client status. Look up the criteria for this. Only if you qualify can you get around the restriction of any broker even permitted to let you access these products. But let's say you do qualify for this status. Now to find a broker who provides access to these products. Look no further than Interactive Brokers for this and after opening an account, get it configured for Mifid Professional client status. Once done, request trading permissions for complex and leveraged products (you will get this straightaway). Hurrah, you are now able to buy into any of the Bitcoin etfs / etps  from exchanges abroad. 

Hey but what about sipp. Stay with me here. Interactive Brokers have partnered with three sipp Administrators. I will save you the trouble by telling you that only one out of the three (optionspensions) will be willing to open sipp with bitcoin etf / etp in it. Their fees are reasonable. You will need to sign up with them and they will open your SIPP account at Interactive Brokers. Once done, hurrah, you are now eligible to access Bitcoin etfs/etps in this sipp. If you had BTCE from 2020 in a sipp, you can do an in-specie transfer of that and switch from a 2% product to one of the new 0.2% etfs launched in the US.

This is for informational purpose only and this should be an open discussion for constructive talking.*

It started in late 2023 when people staked just 1 SOL on Jito and received around \~$15k in JITO tokens. Similar happend with PYTH where people got very big airdrops.

Then there was the big Celestia TIA airdrop for stakers of Cosmos Hub.

This got many people excited and greedy to receive more airdrops and the projects are actively luring people into buying or interacting with their protocols in order to be eligible for airdrops:

**1) ""Points farming"":** 

DeFi projects displaying ""points"" for doing tasks like lending/borrowing/long-/shorting/swapping. All of this is being game-i-fied by using flashy numbers going up, multipliers for doing special tasks.

**2) Staking airdropped coins/tokens for even more airdrops:**

There are dozens of projects which are said to airdrop tokens to people who stake TIA (a coin which was airdropped). Rumors also say that staking PYTH will make one eligible for other airdrops. Injective INJ stakers will get airdrops, too. Many other coins like e.g. MANTA say that staking them will eventually make you eligible for airdops.

**3) Owning NFTs for airdrops:** Simply own certain NFTs to get ""whitelists"", coins/token or even more NFTs airdropped

**4) Bridging coins to a L2 to receive airdrops**

**5) Having a history of several transactions on certain chains/bridges/ having made swaps on wallets like Phantom/Metamask...**

Projects want to reward its users with their own token when these projects decide to launch one.

===============

But there are also disadvantages of airdrops:

1) People blindly ape into coins, staking them in hope to be eligible for an airdrop:

\- they lock themselves by staking the coins, it usually takes days to unstake these coins. In case the price tanks and one wants to sell their coins, they need to wait until the unbonding is finished

\- the criteria for the airdrops are secret. Projects usually did a snapshot BEFORE they actually announce the airdrop. People may have not stake enough coins to be eligible

2) A lot of scams are floating around:

\- unwary people click on scam links to claim fake coins

\- scam projects release useless tokens, but which requires people to invest a certain amount of money

3) overdilution of participants in the airdrop:

\- even if the project is legit, if too many people are eligible for an airdrop, the actual airdrop will be so small

\- some projects incentivizes people to participate in testnets. If too many peope participate + bots farming these testnets, the airdrop will be very small and disappointing
