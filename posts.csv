2,CryptoCurrency,Been buying bitcoin every month for 76 months now,"Started in October 2017 with the goal of 'enough bitcoin to retire'. Got the general idea from the FIRE community (financial independence, retire early) but instead of buying the S&amp;P every month, I chose to buy bitcoin every month. So, basically I save as much as possible from every salary --&gt; buy as much bitcoin every month as possible. When I have a stack of 1 million euros in fiat terms, I consider myself as successfully retired and most likely gonna quit my job. I document my journey in this blog that I try to update once per month, hopefully you like it interesting and motivating! And whatever your capacity and timing for stacking sats is, I'm pretty sure this kind of 'bitcoin retirement plan' is way more efficient than the government one, so starting anything similar is highly recommended. Enjoy reading!

8,CryptoCurrency,Binance withdrawals problems are back. And a friendly reminder that Monero withdrawals are still closed for HTX and Poloniex after &gt; 2 months.,"Plenty of things going on in the space behind closed doors. As we see the price cartel consisting of HTX, Poloniex, Binance and OKX at the core that suppressed Monero prices for nearly 5 years is falling apart.

OKX already delisted Monero resulting in a little price dip. At the same time HTX and Poloniex are insolvent reporting gigantic fake volumes with a none existant order book. Justin's FDT (fiat derivative token) TrueUSD has been depegged for 3 weeks counting.

The last man standing is Binance, but they are entering a new wave of withdrawal problems themselves. Since this was such a huge problem in 2021and 2022 the Monero community created this tracker: https://moneroj.net/withdrawals/

Binance is married to Monero. They had the upper hand for around 4 years but since around 1 year, Monero stopped behaving in the intended way and is now forcing Binance hands. Binance on one hand needs to delist Monero as soon as possible, but on the other can not do it because liabilities would force it straight into publicly known insolvency. They were the first to start the fractional reserve scheme. And while those others could potentially use Binance liquidity (while Binance still tries to keep prices down) this is not an option for Binance as they have been the control center of the cartel.

There is one recommendation: Stay as far away of any CEXs in the next couple of weeks as you can and stack your Monero self-custodialy.

Paying for any other fees (like exchange fees) would also be useful if the user can select which way to pay (there should be settings ""pay all fees with specific fiat currency"" - with a drop-down menu to select the preferred fiat currency; if there is no balance in that fiat currency other currency in the list will be used).

Context:

Paying for fees with cryptocurrency triggers a tax event. It's like buying a candy with cryptocurrency.

For this reason, I propose cryptocurrency exchanges to allow payments in fiat currencies for the fees instead of paying in cryptocurrency (if it's preferable by the user).

For example, the fee for withdrawing cryptocurrency on-chain.

The fee for the transaction is not a big problem because always the capital gain/loss is zero (because it's paid at the same time as the order is executed).",0.72,31,0,31,1706342123.0,2024-01-27 07:55:23,[]

22,CryptoCurrency,Bitcoin Mempool Ordinal / BRC-20 / DataCarrier transaction comparison?,"Last year I recall seeing a pie-chart that showed how much of the BTC mempool consisted of what type of TXNs. Chart included Legacy, Segwit, Taproot, P2SH, as well as some wedge dedicated to Ordinals or BSC-20. I recall Ordinals / BSC-20 was ""most"" of the mempool.

I've tried and for the life of me I can't find it anywhere. Does anyone recall where that chart might be?

As to WHY I'm interested has to do with the impact of full mempools on TXN costs.  Or more specifically, the cost of moving UTXOs.  Unlike Ethereum, Bitcoin creates a new UTXO for every TXN.  When accumulating Bitcoin, this can lead to dozen's, hundreds, or even thousands of UTXOs.  The TXN cost scales purely based on the UTXO count, not the amount, so a large UTXO set can be expensive to cash in since moving them could be a large percentage of their current value.

Although I know my current number of UTXOs, for planning purposes I need to anticipate what the mining fee rate might be when I try to cash these in in 5, 10, or 15 years.  If the costs stay where they are today, about 60 sat/vB, then that's fine.  But if they grow over 1000 sat/vB then some of my UTXOs could be getting close to dust.  I, personally, feel that Ordinals, BSC-20 tokens, and other datacarrier transactions could help to raise these TXN costs indefinitely.  So to that point, I'd like to monitor whether Ordinals, BSC-20, and datacarrier TXNs are increasing month for month or decreasing over time.  It will help to inform my future investment in Bitcoin.

As a concrete example, there was a post recently where someone bought 0.25 BTC over the course of 4 years.  The bought every day with the intention of getting to 0.25 BTC.  So if all of these individual buys were withdrawn to a hardware wallet, the UTXO count would be 1460 UTXOs.  Even with a balance of 0.25 BTC, the TXN cost to move such a large UTXO set would be almost 0.15 BTC.  That's 60% of the investment consumed by TXN fees.  And that is just at the 2024 fee levels.

So... anyone know a site that an break out the current Bitcoin MEMPOOL into transaction types such as ""datacarrier"" and ""non-datacarrier""?  Or even better, if they can show segwit, taproot, ordinal, bsc-20 and the like.",0.67,2,0,2,1706382807.0,2024-01-27 19:13:27,"['Bitcoin', 'btc', 'Ethereum']"

25,CryptoCurrency,"I Took Out $94,000 in Personal Loans to Buy Crypto: 19 Month Update","Not financial advice. 

Greetings All,  

This is my 19 month update since I first took out an unsecured personal loan to buy Bitcoin. You can find my previous updates in my post history. The first is from June 2022. 

A lot has happened since my last update, so I’ll get right to it…

&amp;#x200B;

First off, I managed to completely pay off my 2nd loan of $20,000! 

Work has been better than usual and I had a big job in December that netted me a $12,000 windfall of which the entirety was put towards my loan balance.

Next I decided to buy even more Bitcoin by taking advantage of some really awesome Credit Card Balance Transfer offers that appeared in August/September…

Two of my credit cards were offering 0% APR for the first 18 and 21 months with a one time 3% and 5% transfer fee respectively. I also opened a new card that was offering a similar deal and was approved for a $12,000 limit. That combined with my previous two credit card brought my total to $40,000 in balance transfer potential. 

Balance transfer offers are great because they allow you to simply write a check to yourself and cash it in your bank account like any other check. Also, I’m only responsible to pay 1% each month, so servicing it is really easy. 

I ended up using $35,000 in balance transfer loans and buying 1.35 Bitcoin at an average price of \~$26,500. This brings my total amount of Bitcoin purchased with loans to 4 Bitcoin!!!!

**With the balance transfer monthly payments, plus the previous loans, my total monthly cost to service all these loans is \~$800.** 

I can easily afford this. In fact, I’m putting almost double that towards these loans each month to pay them down aggressively so I don’t end up paying a lot of interest when it’s all said and done. I plan to have everything paid off in less than two years. 

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

**As of today, of the combined loans / balance transfers I have a total remaining balance of \~$56,000.**

It works out like this:

$21,000 remaining balance from unsecured personal loan.

$35,000 from new balance transfer loans. 

This brings the total amount of loans that I’ve taken out so far to $94,000. I’ve paid a total of \~$4,500 in interest to date, which brings the total cost basis of these loans to \~$98,500 as of January 24th, 2024.

**I have acquired a total of 4 Bitcoin at an average price of \~$24,625 per coin: $98,500 / 4 = $24,625.** 

**As of today, January 25th, 2024, the current price of Bitcoin is \~$40,000.**

**This brings the total value of the Bitcoin I acquired from loans to $160,000.**

**This represents an unrealized USD profit of \~$61,500.** 

The math is simple: $160,000 - $98,500 = $61,500

Lastly, I’m officially done taking out loans and balance transfers. I have a nice round number of Bitcoin from loans, plus my personal stack which I’ve been slowly adding to from earned income. Now it’s time to focus on paying everything down over the next 2 years with earned income. I have no desire to sell my Bitcoin regardless of how high its price goes. 

Let me know if you have any questions.

The patterns are playing out very similar to last cycle. Litecoins in a huge 2 cycle bull flag and with the Bitcoin ETF approval, this third cycle may be the breakout cycle for Litecoin. How many LTC's do you think is need to be comfortable this cycle? I mean like to quit your job?

Litecoin may not have performed as well as some of the other coins out there but it's a safe bet second to that of bitcoin but with a wild card possibility for it to moon based on a number of factors, which makes it more attractive than bitcoin imo.

Please be aware there are two possible paths from now to breakout. See chart lines in orange and grey.  Grey shows a small pump from here and then a dump first before we're off to the races.  
**This BTC rally above to 42k may just be a dead cat bounce.  So you have been advised. DYOR.**

42,CryptoCurrency,Week 9 RCC Performance Update - With Bonus Content!,"Happy Friday Everyone! Hope you're having a great day, it's a rainy Friday here where I'm writing from so hopefully weather is better where you read it from. We've got a two parter today: one being the regular weekly update and part two at the bottom I'm doing a month by month comparison to start drawing so more longer term trends. Apologies in advance for the length today. 

Link to Previous Update Post: [Week 7 Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1951hox/week_7_of_my_rcp_performance_tracker/)

**Part 1:**

So without further adieu here's and the data from last week, 1.19.24:

https://preview.redd.it/x29rgahp7tec1.png?width=684&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ddb277abfaae38d627dcdf783e27cdc7561424a

And here's the data from this week, 1.26.24:

https://preview.redd.it/o2xa3yzp7tec1.png?width=685&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7566f5dfabd2318076a66f29035dfc61a054993

Observations and thoughts:

1. The first thing that jumped out at me is that this is the first time in a number of weeks that we saw some price appreciation in BRICK. I'll be honest I do not follow that sub very closely, maybe someone can help fill in something that may have caused this? But that was surprising.
2. Second thing is that GONE is just chugging along. I think it may be headed for a breakout as the other Polygon RCCs start dropping back. CONE is hanging in there and finally crossed the 26,000 holder number! Big congrats there. 
3. Another interesting thing is that MOON has steadily been dropping in it's supply but the price has also been consistently dropping. However, the number of holders has continued to rise. I wouldn't have guessed that those events would correlate but I think it may be possible we see a bit of an uptick on MOON if holder numbers continue to move upwards.
4. You'll see last week that TACO made a nice jump and overtook PLUNGER on the weekly Market Cap list but PLUNGER flipped 'em back (barely) this week. I thought that was interesting TACO has been creeping up on them for a few weeks now. 
5. Finally I did a little bit of extra research peeking into some of the communities that are on the lower end up the Market Cap here just try and gauge engagement and potential opportunities. It seems engagement in those communities has dropped off a good bit which could be cause for concern. Also, I tried playing around with swaps on MetaMask and found that attempting to swap tokens of those subs was rather difficult which to me means that liquidity looks to be starting to dry up. It may seem like a buy the dip moment but low liquidity can cause you headaches when those bags get heavy.

Anybody sees anything I may have missed or if anything jumps out to you I'd love to here from you!

**Part 2:**

Month-by-Month Analysis - Market Caps

https://preview.redd.it/cu1vtefq7tec1.png?width=431&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=117f57c4cf96f7fcbc8ffef3961c1dd72119d1a9

These charts will show where the market cap for the coin/token was when I started tracking and where it stands at the two month updates I've had so far. 

On maybe a more positive note than point 5, it looks like most of the RCC tokens are up overall from when I started tracking. While MOON, BRICK and DONUT are all down pretty bigly from when I started tracking.

Month-by-Month Analysis - Holders

https://preview.redd.it/i11nx2vq7tec1.png?width=431&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=076d6733f74b947b1253e475e52ff77905e519ab

Holder numbers continue to climb upward, with PLUNGER showing out big time here with their big pop the first month. I also find it pretty interesting that DONUT is the only one in the red here. I think once they get switched over to Arbitrum that will hopefully quell their numbers dropping but time will tell. Prior to looking at this information about holders I put a lot of stock into seeing progress here but now I think I may need to not consider it quite as much when determining my thoughts on each token.

That's all for now! Thanks for hanging with me through it. Hope you have a great rest of your day!",0.64,3,0,3,1706286119.0,2024-01-26 16:21:59,"['link', 'Polygon', 'Arbitrum']"

I've seen a number of phishing scams use the 'increaseAllowance' function of late to drain wallets. Most of these can be attributed to known Scams as a Service wallet drainers like Inferno, Pink, Angel, and others.

The CREATE2 Function creates new wallet addresses for each malicious signature. According to Scamsniffer, after the victim signs the signature, the Drainer creates a contract at that address and transfers the user’s assets.

60,CryptoCurrency,Planned Obsolescence and the Tokenized Economy,"I never really understood what a smart contract was until someone phrased it like this.

An NFT can be representative of an asset.  When you trade that asset, the smart contract can give the creator 10-25% of the revenue of that sale.

This means, people can buy any digital asset and trade it amongst each other.  The company producing the good or digital product can then still be profitable while decentralizing ownership.  This cuts out a portion of vendor profits though.  But it could be arguable that the gross profit increases due to sale frequency increasing overall, due to the reduced price and the ownership of licensing.

This sort of model has been flipped on its head in the software world though, because we now have a trend towards subscription service rather than a perpetual license.

&amp;#x200B;

Tokenizing physical assets and tying them to warranties can incentivize manufacturers to build products to last.  When someone sells a washer or a refrigerator -- imagine if it came with an NFT that was basically a warranty.  If something happens to the fridge, you can use your NFT to get a discount on repairs from the manufacturer.  When you sell the Samsung refrigerator to someone else, you also sell the NFT and the manufacturer gets a percentage of the sale.

This 'programmable money' decentralizes ownership and provides services while routing money to the correct parties.  Manufacturers of goods are also incentivized to make their product to be longer lasting so additional sales can be performed on the same item.  Everybody wins, even the environment.  The age of buy and throw away would be disincentivized. ",0.75,21,0,21,1706195714.0,2024-01-25 15:15:14,[]

63,CryptoCurrency,Greyscale just moved another 760 million worth of BTC to Coinbase. With their monster stack of 525k BTC can they prevent a bull market in 2024? Why do they keep selling on Coinbase instead of OTC?,"If Greyscale’s investors(customers) decided to own 0 GBTC they can literally keep bringing the price down, wait for 40K BTC, sell a billion, bring it down to 35k-30k BTC, wait one week for the price to recover, sell again at 40K.

They can keep doing this for quite a long period of time, this can keep going even after the BTC halving.

There is not enough purchase power to absorb 1 billion worth of BTC sold weekly (at 40k$).
That's literally 21 Billion worth of BTC(525k x 40k).  That's 5 months selling a billion worth of BTC each week at 40k.

I'm also curious why aren't they selling OTC? Aren't there some laws for that? Selling spot on Coinbase every time absolutely kills the market.
Who has interest to keep BTC low? Are they helping Blackrock and the others to acquire cheap BTC as much as possible? What's the idea here? 

Honestly I feel if Greyscale stopped selling for a month BTC would go 50k + instantly.

65,CryptoCurrency,Is it just me or is this a common misconception of the BTC price cycle?,"I keep seeing people expecting a crypto bull rally and new ATH prices in late autumn of 2024 based on the previous halving cycle price movement relationship. Everyone sees a halving followed by the boom, but no one seems to be counting the time between halvings and booms when they make this assertion. Historically it's 500-550 days post halving when we see a new ATH, this puts us on track for September/October 2025 presently. 

Am I crazy for thinking there's some mass crypto-bro mandella effect where the bros forget that the halving and ATH never hit in the same year?

Edit: didn't expect so many responses and additions to the discussion. For the sake of clarity, I should say that my definition of ATH in the context I was using, it is much different from many of your own.

If you're buying whatever is getting pushed on youtube by a youtuber, there's a chance you'll make some money, there's a chance you'll lose some money. The exchanges don't care about that. They care about the fees that you pay when you trade...                 

You know, that fee you paid when you traded USDT or FIAT for that one coin you wanted? And then that other fee you paid when it went down in value and you hopped onto the next hyped coin? And then that other fee you paid to withdraw that coin from the exchange and put it on your hardware wallet or hot wallet? Yeah, you and tens of thousands of other people paid the same fee, netting the exchange(s) a few thousand dollars.               

This is precisely why you see exchanges promoting -insert coin here- trading contest. They take the trading fees. And if there are derivatives on it, that's even more beneficial to the exchange because then you are literally gambling against the house. It is also the same exact reason why you see the exchanges willing to take meme coins and promote trading of said meme coins on their exchanges.

71,CryptoCurrency,"[AMA] Risk management for crypto investors, Jan 26","The AMA is over. Thank you all for participating!

\----------------------------------------

Hello Reddit,

I'm Sylvain Chassang, an Econ Prof at Princeton, and a cautiously optimistic crypto investor since 2018. I'm here to discuss risk management, and the work we do at [www.golucid.io](https://www.golucid.io), where I help build and maintain risk-managed portfolio indices. Our mission is to help people take better risks.

I'll be live Friday January 26 from 9AM to noon, New York time (2pm to 5pm UTC).

My goal for this AMA is to have a conversation on risk-management in crypto, and learn from your experiences. Ask me anything about what we do. Bring up the challenges you’ve faced as investors, and aspects of the market that puzzle you. Share tips on how you manage your own risk exposure. Feel free to get into the nitty gritty of risk-management techniques and implementation challenges.

Note: everything I say is for discussion &amp; educational purposes; nothing I say should be taken as financial or legal advice.

Sylvain

\----------------------------------------

Risk Management Handbook

As prep for this AMA, I wrote a guide on risk management for crypto. It’s available [here](https://docs.golucid.io/static/pdf/lucid_handbook.pdf) makes the following points:

1. Risk management in crypto isn't just about avoiding losses, it can help you compound faster.
2. Volatility is not always a bad sign in crypto. Unlike equities, high volatility periods in crypto are not associated with lower returns.
3. Sudden crashes grab headlines, but long sequences of small losses are surprisingly frequent and can erode wealth.
4. Regular rebalancing and drawdown control can both help you deal with those risks and compound faster.
5. Risk management always causes regret over the short run. If you can, it’s better not to look.

I hope this guide is useful to you.

74,CryptoCurrency,What happened at Davos regarding regulation and LCX?,"First and foremost I know most of us aren't a big fan of the WEF and their plans for centralization, CBDC's and full blown regulation in the crypto space. I'm also in the anti-regulation team so make no mistake about that. 

One crypto company in particular, LCX (short for the Liechtenstein Crypto assets Exchange) was very present over there, hosted a diner with a lot of eminent people in the crypto space as well as a bunch of eminent Liechtenstein politicians. This year their booth was right next to Coinbases booth.

LCX attends Davos every year and it's always the same story: little pump during the event, hard correction afterwards, except for this year. We're witnessing the crypto market is in a downtrend the past two weeks and usually LCX would drop twice as much as the rest. Not this year. It keeps pumping against the market. 

I've got to give it to them that the presentations were much better, the exposure was a lot more and the people attending the speeches and the diner were the kind of people with big bags of money or were quite important compared to other years. 

So what is that they spoke about at Davos and who is investing into this? I have a feeling they are cooking something at the WEF with the support of big banking and politicians, so I can't help myself but to think LCX is going to have a big roll in the near future in the crypto space. Does anybody have more info about what is said behind the WEF curtains? Do we have somebody in this sub who attended Davos and maybe picked up something over there? 

Again: I'm not favouring any of this, but I'm not allergic to making a hell of a lot of money. And I have a gut feeling this could be the golden ticket. 

So if anybody knows anything I'd highly appreciate it if you step forward. I do own a bag of LCX but considering the above I'm eager to expand the bag with a substantial amount.

80,CryptoCurrency,UK ISA / SIPP - my findings on how to get proper Bitcoin exposure,"After a lot of digging around, here are my findings:

ISA: Under the current HMRC guidance on qualifying investments, there is NO route as of now to getting direct etp / etf bitcoin exposure in an ISA. That's mainly because no such products in the market are UK ucits or recognised UCITS. However, if you retain isa positions in BTCE (which you could have in the July to Dec 2020 window) then these remain eligible but only as long as you hold them. Once you sell, you cannot re-enter this within an ISA.

SIPP: Here is where things are interesting. The first thing you need to access Bitcoin etps / etfs is to be able to qualify for a Mifid Professional Client status. Look up the criteria for this. Only if you qualify can you get around the restriction of any broker even permitted to let you access these products. But let's say you do qualify for this status. Now to find a broker who provides access to these products. Look no further than Interactive Brokers for this and after opening an account, get it configured for Mifid Professional client status. Once done, request trading permissions for complex and leveraged products (you will get this straightaway). Hurrah, you are now able to buy into any of the Bitcoin etfs / etps  from exchanges abroad. 

Hey but what about sipp. Stay with me here. Interactive Brokers have partnered with three sipp Administrators. I will save you the trouble by telling you that only one out of the three (optionspensions) will be willing to open sipp with bitcoin etf / etp in it. Their fees are reasonable. You will need to sign up with them and they will open your SIPP account at Interactive Brokers. Once done, hurrah, you are now eligible to access Bitcoin etfs/etps in this sipp. If you had BTCE from 2020 in a sipp, you can do an in-specie transfer of that and switch from a 2% product to one of the new 0.2% etfs launched in the US.

Good luck and please do your own due diligence on above.",0.73,5,0,5,1706178285.0,2024-01-25 10:24:45,['Bitcoin']

Tether's USDT claimed 70.6% dominance, amidst emerging players like Collateralized Debt Position and LST-backed stablecoins.
* NFT Resurgence: Non-Fungible Tokens rebounded impressively in Q4, with December volumes reaching US$1.7B. Bitcoin NFTs witnessed significant growth, and the NFT marketplace wars intensified, with the upcoming Blur-aligned L2, Blast, adding an intriguing dimension to the landscape.

83,CryptoCurrency,"Crypto.com is now 9th largest exchange by spot volume, with more spot volume than Kraken and Kucoin","Crypto.com is on track to surpass its Dec 22 spot trading volume of 31.9b (a 19-month record), beating major competitors like KuCoin and Kraken in the process. 

Ranking up from spot 11, Crypto.com is now the 9th largest crypto exchange in terms of spot volume, with a little bit over 3 percent of global spot volume (for context, the 2nd largest exchange, UpBit, has over 8 percent global volume). 

[CDC 12m spot volume](https://preview.redd.it/g6he4hc9jdec1.png?width=1724&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b714fe5492d35f7f5c833aedd1f1c1c1d0f76674)

The market continues to be volatile, with flash crashes, sudden recovery, and prolonged consolidation after the early Jan ETF approval by the SEC. Crypto.com has capitalised on this opportunity by recording 28.28b in volume (excluding derivatives) for the month of January so far. The spot volume on the platform is reaching levels last seen in q2 of 2022 or in the run-up to the 2021 bull run. 

[CDC spot slumped to all time lows mid 2022, but the exchange has been experiencing a continuous uptrend since then](https://preview.redd.it/b9ajpyymjdec1.png?width=1725&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=333cccfb25058b02032896b3717792bed6bb9b5b)

However, the data is incomplete, with more than a week to go until the end of the month. It should comfortably reach over 33b in spot volume based on the exchange's performance and market participants' behaviour so far. 📈

Crypto.com (28.28b) has also been able to pull more ahead of its major competitors like Kraken (24.49b) and KuCoin (24.79b), confirming the breakout from Dec 22. When compared, the CDC now has the largest share of the spot market out of the three, leading by over 4 percent. To catch up, both Kraken and KuCoin would need extra approx. three trading days.

More interestingly, CDC spot volume continues to increase MoM, and Crypto.com is now in hot pursuit of Gate.io, which has over 2 percent lead in terms of market share (down from over a 12 percent lead in Dec 22). Gate.io has recorded 31.7b spot volume for the month of January so far (over 3b lead ahead of CDC).
