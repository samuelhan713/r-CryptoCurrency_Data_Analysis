2,0.011,0.751,0.237,0.9923,CryptoCurrency,Been buying bitcoin every month for 76 months now,"Started in October 2017 with the goal of 'enough bitcoin to retire'. Got the general idea from the FIRE community (financial independence, retire early) but instead of buying the S&amp;P every month, I chose to buy bitcoin every month. So, basically I save as much as possible from every salary --&gt; buy as much bitcoin every month as possible. When I have a stack of 1 million euros in fiat terms, I consider myself as successfully retired and most likely gonna quit my job. I document my journey in this blog that I try to update once per month, hopefully you like it interesting and motivating! And whatever your capacity and timing for stacking sats is, I'm pretty sure this kind of 'bitcoin retirement plan' is way more efficient than the government one, so starting anything similar is highly recommended. Enjoy reading!

And a friendly reminder that Monero withdrawals are still closed for HTX and Poloniex after &gt; 2 months.,"Plenty of things going on in the space behind closed doors. As we see the price cartel consisting of HTX, Poloniex, Binance and OKX at the core that suppressed Monero prices for nearly 5 years is falling apart.

OKX already delisted Monero resulting in a little price dip. At the same time HTX and Poloniex are insolvent reporting gigantic fake volumes with a none existant order book. Justin's FDT (fiat derivative token) TrueUSD has been depegged for 3 weeks counting.

The last man standing is Binance, but they are entering a new wave of withdrawal problems themselves. Since this was such a huge problem in 2021and 2022 the Monero community created this tracker: https://moneroj.net/withdrawals/

Binance is married to Monero. They had the upper hand for around 4 years but since around 1 year, Monero stopped behaving in the intended way and is now forcing Binance hands. Binance on one hand needs to delist Monero as soon as possible, but on the other can not do it because liabilities would force it straight into publicly known insolvency. They were the first to start the fractional reserve scheme. And while those others could potentially use Binance liquidity (while Binance still tries to keep prices down) this is not an option for Binance as they have been the control center of the cartel.

There is one recommendation: Stay as far away of any CEXs in the next couple of weeks as you can and stack your Monero self-custodialy.

Paying for any other fees (like exchange fees) would also be useful if the user can select which way to pay (there should be settings ""pay all fees with specific fiat currency"" - with a drop-down menu to select the preferred fiat currency; if there is no balance in that fiat currency other currency in the list will be used).

Context:

Paying for fees with cryptocurrency triggers a tax event. It's like buying a candy with cryptocurrency.

For this reason, I propose cryptocurrency exchanges to allow payments in fiat currencies for the fees instead of paying in cryptocurrency (if it's preferable by the user).

For example, the fee for withdrawing cryptocurrency on-chain.

The fee for the transaction is not a big problem because always the capital gain/loss is zero (because it's paid at the same time as the order is executed).",0.68,18,0,18,1706342123.0,2024-01-27 07:55:23,[]

Greetings All,  

This is my 19 month update since I first took out an unsecured personal loan to buy Bitcoin. You can find my previous updates in my post history. The first is from June 2022. 

A lot has happened since my last update, so I‚Äôll get right to it‚Ä¶

&amp;#x200B;

First off, I managed to completely pay off my 2nd loan of $20,000! 

Work has been better than usual and I had a big job in December that netted me a $12,000 windfall of which the entirety was put towards my loan balance.

Next I decided to buy even more Bitcoin by taking advantage of some really awesome Credit Card Balance Transfer offers that appeared in August/September‚Ä¶

Two of my credit cards were offering 0% APR for the first 18 and 21 months with a one time 3% and 5% transfer fee respectively. I also opened a new card that was offering a similar deal and was approved for a $12,000 limit. That combined with my previous two credit card brought my total to $40,000 in balance transfer potential. 

Balance transfer offers are great because they allow you to simply write a check to yourself and cash it in your bank account like any other check. Also, I‚Äôm only responsible to pay 1% each month, so servicing it is really easy. 

I ended up using $35,000 in balance transfer loans and buying 1.35 Bitcoin at an average price of \~$26,500. This brings my total amount of Bitcoin purchased with loans to 4 Bitcoin!!!!

**With the balance transfer monthly payments, plus the previous loans, my total monthly cost to service all these loans is \~$800.** 

I can easily afford this. In fact, I‚Äôm putting almost double that towards these loans each month to pay them down aggressively so I don‚Äôt end up paying a lot of interest when it‚Äôs all said and done. I plan to have everything paid off in less than two years. 

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

**As of today, of the combined loans / balance transfers I have a total remaining balance of \~$56,000.**

It works out like this:

$21,000 remaining balance from unsecured personal loan.

$35,000 from new balance transfer loans. 

This brings the total amount of loans that I‚Äôve taken out so far to $94,000. I‚Äôve paid a total of \~$4,500 in interest to date, which brings the total cost basis of these loans to \~$98,500 as of January 24th, 2024.

**I have acquired a total of 4 Bitcoin at an average price of \~$24,625 per coin: $98,500 / 4 = $24,625.** 

**As of today, January 25th, 2024, the current price of Bitcoin is \~$40,000.**

**This brings the total value of the Bitcoin I acquired from loans to $160,000.**

**This represents an unrealized USD profit of \~$61,500.** 

The math is simple: $160,000 - $98,500 = $61,500

Lastly, I‚Äôm officially done taking out loans and balance transfers. I have a nice round number of Bitcoin from loans, plus my personal stack which I‚Äôve been slowly adding to from earned income. Now it‚Äôs time to focus on paying everything down over the next 2 years with earned income. I have no desire to sell my Bitcoin regardless of how high its price goes. 

Let me know if you have any questions.

When they are positioned as so with the 50(green) between the 200(red) above and 100(blue) below, we are position for a pump and rally above the major resistance line as we've seen last cycle. The patterns are playing out very similar to last cycle. Litecoins in a huge 2 cycle bull flag and with the Bitcoin ETF approval, this third cycle may be the breakout cycle for Litecoin. How many LTC's do you think is need to be comfortable this cycle? I mean like to quit your job?

Litecoin may not have performed as well as some of the other coins out there but it's a safe bet second to that of bitcoin but with a wild card possibility for it to moon based on a number of factors, which makes it more attractive than bitcoin imo.

Please be aware there are two possible paths from now to breakout. See chart lines in orange and grey.  Grey shows a small pump from here and then a dump first before we're off to the races.

\------------------

# Timeline of Moons since Reddit Sunset their Involvement

Lets start with a quick timeline of things you may be partially familiar with:

* **Oct. 17th 2023:** Reddit Announces they'll be ""SunSetting"" their involvement in Moons.
* **Nov. 14th 2023:** Reddit burns all Moons in their possession - dropping the circulating supply of Moons from 126M to 82M.
* **Nov. 30th 2023:** Reddit renounces the Moon Contract - making Moons fully decentralized.
   * This means no one can create Moons, or make change to the Moon contract. The current state of Moons are locked in.
* **Dec. 19th 2023:** Mods announce Governance will be returning via [https://snapshot.org/](https://snapshot.org/#/cryptomods.eth)
* **Jan. 6th 2024:** First Governance polls go live with votes on the following:
   * Restart Moon Distribution **\[PASSED\]**
   * Give More Governance Weight to Newly Earned Moons **\[NO QUORUM \]**
   * Use Existing Reward Formula for Moon Distribution **\[AGAINST\]**
* *\[Upcoming\]* **Jan. 29th 2024:** Moon Week Returning with Governance Polls on the following topics:
   * Proposal to spend $1,100 on legal consultation - Meta Discussion [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencyMeta/comments/19eohpp/information_about_moderator_assets_and_proposal/)
   * Increase event pricing by 50% - Meta Discussion [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencyMeta/comments/19elwip/increase_pricing_of_events_on_rcryptocurrency/)

\------------------

# Analyzing the Ecosystem and Reviewing the State of Moons

**Analyzing the Ecosystem:**

When Reddit announced they would be sunsetting their involvement in Moons many people thought that would be the end of our beloved community token. However the ecosystem that was developed by this community continued chugging along. In the last 100 days since Reddit stepped away from Moons we have burned \~357k Moons on Ecosystem Activity.

**On Jan. 31st the CC Banner will reach it's One Year Birthday and is directly responsible for over 1M Moons being Burned so far!**

**Events on CC (AMAs/Giveaways/etc.) are responsible for another \~70K Moons being burned over the last year.** ***\*Note there is an upcoming vote to increase the price of events 50%.***

\-----

**Reviewing the State of Moons:**

With so many people panic selling Moons after the Reddit Sunset announcement it was clear that if any distribution were to happen in the future the forced HODL and KM system would not work. With this in mind, Moon holders voted to abandon the existing reward formula.

**This means if you panic sold your Moons - your future distributions will not be penalized.**

Speaking of Distributions here's what we know - there is no hard date established for the return of Moon Distributions on CC. Moderators are looking to sell $1.1K in Arbitrum to pay for legal counsel in establishing a Dao that will take control and responsibility of moderator controlled assets and be responsible for future distributions. Moderators have publicly stated until a Dao is established, Distributions are on hold.

**A Governance Vote to sell Arbitrum and pay for legal counsel in establishing a DAO will be on the Moon week relaunch on Jan. 29th.**

*The exact amount of Moons to be distributed per snapshot - is not yet known, but it will be significantly less than prior distributions.*  

\------------------

TLDR:

* Timeline of what has happened since Reddit Sunset their Involvement in Moons.
* Analyzing the Ecosystem relating to Moons spent on the Banner/Events since Sunset (357K Moons) and over the last year (1.1M Moons).
* KM is no more - if you panic sold your Moons you won't be penalized when distributions return.
* Mods are looking at establishing a DAO to take responsibility for Moderator controlled assets, until this is established distributions are on hold.",0.54,5,0,5,1706321212.0,2024-01-27 02:06:52,"['eth', 'etc', 'Arbitrum']"

Hope you're having a great day, it's a rainy Friday here where I'm writing from so hopefully weather is better where you read it from. We've got a two parter today: one being the regular weekly update and part two at the bottom I'm doing a month by month comparison to start drawing so more longer term trends. Apologies in advance for the length today. 

Link to Previous Update Post: [Week 7 Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1951hox/week_7_of_my_rcp_performance_tracker/)

**Part 1:**

So without further adieu here's and the data from last week, 1.19.24:

https://preview.redd.it/x29rgahp7tec1.png?width=684&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ddb277abfaae38d627dcdf783e27cdc7561424a

And here's the data from this week, 1.26.24:

https://preview.redd.it/o2xa3yzp7tec1.png?width=685&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7566f5dfabd2318076a66f29035dfc61a054993

Observations and thoughts:

1. The first thing that jumped out at me is that this is the first time in a number of weeks that we saw some price appreciation in BRICK. I'll be honest I do not follow that sub very closely, maybe someone can help fill in something that may have caused this? But that was surprising.
2. Second thing is that GONE is just chugging along. I think it may be headed for a breakout as the other Polygon RCCs start dropping back. CONE is hanging in there and finally crossed the 26,000 holder number! Big congrats there. 
3. Another interesting thing is that MOON has steadily been dropping in it's supply but the price has also been consistently dropping. However, the number of holders has continued to rise. I wouldn't have guessed that those events would correlate but I think it may be possible we see a bit of an uptick on MOON if holder numbers continue to move upwards.
4. You'll see last week that TACO made a nice jump and overtook PLUNGER on the weekly Market Cap list but PLUNGER flipped 'em back (barely) this week. I thought that was interesting TACO has been creeping up on them for a few weeks now. 
5. Finally I did a little bit of extra research peeking into some of the communities that are on the lower end up the Market Cap here just try and gauge engagement and potential opportunities. It seems engagement in those communities has dropped off a good bit which could be cause for concern. Also, I tried playing around with swaps on MetaMask and found that attempting to swap tokens of those subs was rather difficult which to me means that liquidity looks to be starting to dry up. It may seem like a buy the dip moment but low liquidity can cause you headaches when those bags get heavy.

Anybody sees anything I may have missed or if anything jumps out to you I'd love to here from you!

**Part 2:**

Month-by-Month Analysis - Market Caps

https://preview.redd.it/cu1vtefq7tec1.png?width=431&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=117f57c4cf96f7fcbc8ffef3961c1dd72119d1a9

These charts will show where the market cap for the coin/token was when I started tracking and where it stands at the two month updates I've had so far. 

On maybe a more positive note than point 5, it looks like most of the RCC tokens are up overall from when I started tracking. While MOON, BRICK and DONUT are all down pretty bigly from when I started tracking.

Month-by-Month Analysis - Holders

https://preview.redd.it/i11nx2vq7tec1.png?width=431&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=076d6733f74b947b1253e475e52ff77905e519ab

Holder numbers continue to climb upward, with PLUNGER showing out big time here with their big pop the first month. I also find it pretty interesting that DONUT is the only one in the red here. I think once they get switched over to Arbitrum that will hopefully quell their numbers dropping but time will tell. Prior to looking at this information about holders I put a lot of stock into seeing progress here but now I think I may need to not consider it quite as much when determining my thoughts on each token.

That's all for now! Thanks for hanging with me through it. Hope you have a great rest of your day!",0.78,5,0,5,1706286119.0,2024-01-26 16:21:59,"['link', 'Polygon', 'Arbitrum']"

I've seen a number of phishing scams use the 'increaseAllowance' function of late to drain wallets. Most of these can be attributed to known Scams as a Service wallet drainers like Inferno, Pink, Angel, and others.

The CREATE2 Function creates new wallet addresses for each malicious signature. According to Scamsniffer, after the victim signs the signature, the Drainer creates a contract at that address and transfers the user‚Äôs assets.

An NFT can be representative of an asset.  When you trade that asset, the smart contract can give the creator 10-25% of the revenue of that sale.

This means, people can buy any digital asset and trade it amongst each other.  The company producing the good or digital product can then still be profitable while decentralizing ownership.  This cuts out a portion of vendor profits though.  But it could be arguable that the gross profit increases due to sale frequency increasing overall, due to the reduced price and the ownership of licensing.

This sort of model has been flipped on its head in the software world though, because we now have a trend towards subscription service rather than a perpetual license.

&amp;#x200B;

Tokenizing physical assets and tying them to warranties can incentivize manufacturers to build products to last.  When someone sells a washer or a refrigerator -- imagine if it came with an NFT that was basically a warranty.  If something happens to the fridge, you can use your NFT to get a discount on repairs from the manufacturer.  When you sell the Samsung refrigerator to someone else, you also sell the NFT and the manufacturer gets a percentage of the sale.

This 'programmable money' decentralizes ownership and provides services while routing money to the correct parties.  Manufacturers of goods are also incentivized to make their product to be longer lasting so additional sales can be performed on the same item.  Everybody wins, even the environment.  The age of buy and throw away would be disincentivized. ",0.77,23,0,23,1706195714.0,2024-01-25 15:15:14,[]

Why do they keep selling on Coinbase instead of OTC?,"If Greyscale‚Äôs investors(customers) decided to own 0 GBTC they can literally keep bringing the price down, wait for 40K BTC, sell a billion, bring it down to 35k-30k BTC, wait one week for the price to recover, sell again at 40K.

They can keep doing this for quite a long period of time, this can keep going even after the BTC halving.

There is not enough purchase power to absorb 1 billion worth of BTC sold weekly (at 40k$).
That's literally 21 Billion worth of BTC(525k x 40k).  That's 5 months selling a billion worth of BTC each week at 40k.

I'm also curious why aren't they selling OTC? Aren't there some laws for that? Selling spot on Coinbase every time absolutely kills the market.

Edit: didn't expect so many responses and additions to the discussion. For the sake of clarity, I should say that my definition of ATH in the context I was using, it is much different from many of your own. I was specifically referring to the parabolic all-time high that acts as an indicator for the end of the bull market and the beginning of the bear. This high point specifically is what has occurred between 500 and 550 days after each halving.

If you're buying whatever is getting pushed on youtube by a youtuber, there's a chance you'll make some money, there's a chance you'll lose some money. The exchanges don't care about that. They care about the fees that you pay when you trade...                 

You know, that fee you paid when you traded USDT or FIAT for that one coin you wanted? And then that other fee you paid when it went down in value and you hopped onto the next hyped coin?

\----------------------------------------

Hello Reddit,

I'm Sylvain Chassang, an Econ Prof at Princeton, and a cautiously optimistic crypto investor since 2018. I'm here to discuss risk management, and the work we do at [www.golucid.io](https://www.golucid.io), where I help build and maintain risk-managed portfolio indices. Our mission is to help people take better risks.

I'll be live Friday January 26 from 9AM to noon, New York time (2pm to 5pm UTC).

My goal for this AMA is to have a conversation on risk-management in crypto, and learn from your experiences. Ask me anything about what we do. Bring up the challenges you‚Äôve faced as investors, and aspects of the market that puzzle you. Share tips on how you manage your own risk exposure. Feel free to get into the nitty gritty of risk-management techniques and implementation challenges.

Note: everything I say is for discussion &amp; educational purposes; nothing I say should be taken as financial or legal advice.

Sylvain

\----------------------------------------

Risk Management Handbook

As prep for this AMA, I wrote a guide on risk management for crypto. It‚Äôs available [here](https://docs.golucid.io/static/pdf/lucid_handbook.pdf) makes the following points:

1. Risk management in crypto isn't just about avoiding losses, it can help you compound faster.
2. Volatility is not always a bad sign in crypto. Unlike equities, high volatility periods in crypto are not associated with lower returns.
3. Sudden crashes grab headlines, but long sequences of small losses are surprisingly frequent and can erode wealth.
4. Regular rebalancing and drawdown control can both help you deal with those risks and compound faster.
5. Risk management always causes regret over the short run. If you can, it‚Äôs better not to look.

I hope this guide is useful to you.

70,0.051,0.875,0.074,0.759,CryptoCurrency,What happened at Davos regarding regulation and LCX?,"First and foremost I know most of us aren't a big fan of the WEF and their plans for centralization, CBDC's and full blown regulation in the crypto space. I'm also in the anti-regulation team so make no mistake about that. 

One crypto company in particular, LCX (short for the Liechtenstein Crypto assets Exchange) was very present over there, hosted a diner with a lot of eminent people in the crypto space as well as a bunch of eminent Liechtenstein politicians. This year their booth was right next to Coinbases booth.

LCX attends Davos every year and it's always the same story: little pump during the event, hard correction afterwards, except for this year. We're witnessing the crypto market is in a downtrend the past two weeks and usually LCX would drop twice as much as the rest. Not this year. It keeps pumping against the market. 

I've got to give it to them that the presentations were much better, the exposure was a lot more and the people attending the speeches and the diner were the kind of people with big bags of money or were quite important compared to other years. 

So what is that they spoke about at Davos and who is investing into this? I have a feeling they are cooking something at the WEF with the support of big banking and politicians, so I can't help myself but to think LCX is going to have a big roll in the near future in the crypto space. Does anybody have more info about what is said behind the WEF curtains? Do we have somebody in this sub who attended Davos and maybe picked up something over there? 

Again: I'm not favouring any of this, but I'm not allergic to making a hell of a lot of money. And I have a gut feeling this could be the golden ticket. 

So if anybody knows anything I'd highly appreciate it if you step forward. I do own a bag of LCX but considering the above I'm eager to expand the bag with a substantial amount.

If you are new user please read below precautions 

1. **Choose a Secure Wallet:** Opt for reputable wallets like hardware wallets (e.g., Ledger, Trezor), software wallets (e.g., Exodus, Electrum), or mobile wallets from trusted providers.

2. **Use Hardware Wallets for Large Amounts:** Hardware wallets are considered more secure, especially for significant amounts of cryptocurrency, as they are offline and less susceptible to online threats.

3. **Keep Software Updated:** Ensure your wallet software is up-to-date to benefit from the latest security features and patches.

4. **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** If your wallet supports it, enable two-factor authentication to add an extra layer of security.

5. **Secure Backup:** Create secure backups of your wallet's recovery seed or private keys. Store them in multiple secure locations, such as a safe or safety deposit box.

6. **Beware of Phishing:** Be cautious of phishing attempts. Only use official websites or links to access your wallet, and never share your private keys or recovery seed.

7. **Use Strong Passwords:** Set a strong, unique password for your wallet to prevent unauthorized access.

8. **Protect Against Malware:** Keep your computer and devices secure by using reputable antivirus and anti-malware software.

9. **Public Wi-Fi Caution:** Avoid accessing your wallet on public Wi-Fi networks to minimize the risk of potential attacks.

10. **Regularly Check Balances:** Monitor your cryptocurrency balances and transactions regularly to detect any unauthorized activity.",0.78,15,0,15,1706155199.0,2024-01-25 03:59:59,[]

76,0.033,0.888,0.079,0.9667,CryptoCurrency,UK ISA / SIPP - my findings on how to get proper Bitcoin exposure,"After a lot of digging around, here are my findings:

ISA: Under the current HMRC guidance on qualifying investments, there is NO route as of now to getting direct etp / etf bitcoin exposure in an ISA. That's mainly because no such products in the market are UK ucits or recognised UCITS. However, if you retain isa positions in BTCE (which you could have in the July to Dec 2020 window) then these remain eligible but only as long as you hold them. Once you sell, you cannot re-enter this within an ISA.

SIPP: Here is where things are interesting. The first thing you need to access Bitcoin etps / etfs is to be able to qualify for a Mifid Professional Client status. Look up the criteria for this. Only if you qualify can you get around the restriction of any broker even permitted to let you access these products. But let's say you do qualify for this status. Now to find a broker who provides access to these products. Look no further than Interactive Brokers for this and after opening an account, get it configured for Mifid Professional client status. Once done, request trading permissions for complex and leveraged products (you will get this straightaway). Hurrah, you are now able to buy into any of the Bitcoin etfs / etps  from exchanges abroad. 

Hey but what about sipp. Stay with me here. Interactive Brokers have partnered with three sipp Administrators. I will save you the trouble by telling you that only one out of the three (optionspensions) will be willing to open sipp with bitcoin etf / etp in it. Their fees are reasonable. You will need to sign up with them and they will open your SIPP account at Interactive Brokers. Once done, hurrah, you are now eligible to access Bitcoin etfs/etps in this sipp. If you had BTCE from 2020 in a sipp, you can do an in-specie transfer of that and switch from a 2% product to one of the new 0.2% etfs launched in the US.

Good luck and please do your own due diligence on above.",0.64,3,0,3,1706178285.0,2024-01-25 10:24:45,['Bitcoin']

Ranking up from spot 11, Crypto.com is now the 9th largest crypto exchange in terms of spot volume, with a little bit over 3 percent of global spot volume (for context, the 2nd largest exchange, UpBit, has over 8 percent global volume).

The market continues to be volatile, with flash crashes, sudden recovery, and prolonged consolidation after the early Jan ETF approval by the SEC. Crypto.com has capitalised on this opportunity by recording 28.28b in volume (excluding derivatives) for the month of January so far. The spot volume on the platform is reaching levels last seen in q2 of 2022 or in the run-up to the 2021 bull run.

However, the data is incomplete, with more than a week to go until the end of the month. It should comfortably reach over 33b in spot volume based on the exchange's performance and market participants' behaviour so far. üìà

Crypto.com (28.28b) has also been able to pull more ahead of its major competitors like Kraken (24.49b) and KuCoin (24.79b), confirming the breakout from Dec 22. When compared, the CDC now has the largest share of the spot market out of the three, leading by over 4 percent. To catch up, both Kraken and KuCoin would need extra approx. three trading days.

This is for informational purpose only and this should be an open discussion for constructive talking.*

It started in late 2023 when people staked just 1 SOL on Jito and received around \~$15k in JITO tokens. Similar happend with PYTH where people got very big airdrops.

Then there was the big Celestia TIA airdrop for stakers of Cosmos Hub.

This got many people excited and greedy to receive more airdrops and the projects are actively luring people into buying or interacting with their protocols in order to be eligible for airdrops:

**1) ""Points farming"":** 

DeFi projects displaying ""points"" for doing tasks like lending/borrowing/long-/shorting/swapping. All of this is being game-i-fied by using flashy numbers going up, multipliers for doing special tasks.

**2) Staking airdropped coins/tokens for even more airdrops:**

There are dozens of projects which are said to airdrop tokens to people who stake TIA (a coin which was airdropped). Rumors also say that staking PYTH will make one eligible for other airdrops. Injective INJ stakers will get airdrops, too. Many other coins like e.g. MANTA say that staking them will eventually make you eligible for airdops.

**3) Owning NFTs for airdrops:** Simply own certain NFTs to get ""whitelists"", coins/token or even more NFTs airdropped

**4) Bridging coins to a L2 to receive airdrops**

**5) Having a history of several transactions on certain chains/bridges/ having made swaps on wallets like Phantom/Metamask...**

Projects want to reward its users with their own token when these projects decide to launch one.

===============

But there are also disadvantages of airdrops:

1) People blindly ape into coins, staking them in hope to be eligible for an airdrop:

\- they lock themselves by staking the coins, it usually takes days to unstake these coins. In case the price tanks and one wants to sell their coins, they need to wait until the unbonding is finished

\- the criteria for the airdrops are secret. Projects usually did a snapshot BEFORE they actually announce the airdrop. People may have not stake enough coins to be eligible

2) A lot of scams are floating around:

\- unwary people click on scam links to claim fake coins

\- scam projects release useless tokens, but which requires people to invest a certain amount of money

3) overdilution of participants in the airdrop:

\- even if the project is legit, if too many people are eligible for an airdrop, the actual airdrop will be so small

\- some projects incentivizes people to participate in testnets. If too many peope participate + bots farming these testnets, the airdrop will be very small and disappointing

85,0.074,0.766,0.159,0.8862,CryptoCurrency,Need help identifying bogus NFT's [Ledger],"Good evening, I'm here calling for help to identify some NFT's I received on my Ledger. I assume most, if not all, are fake and attempts to steal my coins if I meddle with them so I'm not touching them with a ten-foot pole. Still, I must admit that I am curious. Could anyone take a look and inform me if I'm right to leave them alone. I've added screenshots below: first of the overview, then the detail screens. If more info is needed let me know. Many thanks in advance.

EDIT: Thank you all for your replies. Really appreciate it. Conclusion: they‚Äôre all dog shit üí©

86,0.022,0.885,0.093,0.8268,CryptoCurrency,Oldest Vitalik Buterin video?,About 10 years ago I watched an amateur documentary on bitcoin. I just watched an older interview with Vitalik Buterin and I‚Äôm sure he was one of the main people interviewed by the filmmakers. I think I had found it on Pirate Bay maybe? I‚Äôve been looking for the documentary but all the ones that feature Vitalik are newer than that. In the one I‚Äôm looking for he is very awkward in the interviews (obviously before any media training). What are the oldest documentaries you know of that he was in? Where to find them would be nice too. Thanks!,0.62,6,0,6,1706140778.0,2024-01-24 23:59:38,['Bitcoin']

Yesterday, I made a payment/transfer from my bank account to Kraken, as Ive done a dozen times in the past. This morning I got an email saying the payment has been blocked, as Kraken is not registered with the financial authorities in my country. I checked the register on their websites, and could only find a few domestic smaller (and unknown to me) crypto exchanges on the list.

I did notice on Kraken that it is possible to make the payment with a paypal account. Would this bypass the issue? I guess then the payment is strictly made to paypal, which in turns makes the payment to Kraken?
The only alternative I can think of is signing up to one of the smaller unknown exchanges that is approved, and potentially just transfer crypto from there to Kraken.

As you may get from the post, Ive grown quite fond of Kraken over the years and would prefer to keep it as my main hub for the mainstream alts.",0.85,57,0,57,1706094769.0,2024-01-24 11:12:49,[]
